# Exam Paper Analysis Platform
A website platform to display the analysis result data.

## Motivation
In order to help students improve their learning process, we believe that exam papers are one of the important things for teachers to monitor the behavior of one student. We also believe that teachers should also keep improving their exam papers according to the response of the students' behavior. As a result, we build this website platform to perform exam paper analysis and data display, which can help teachers easily monitor both their exam paper and the performance of their students.
